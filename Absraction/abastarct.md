1-Abstarct methode have a key word that have  no defination or no implimatation that is called  or unwanted data are hide  declrered abstract 
- It is a non-access modifier which is used to create abstract class and method.
- Abstract methode you can not creat a object
● The role of an abstract class is to contain abstract methods. However, it may also contain non-abstract methods.
● The method which is declared with an abstract keyword and doesn't have any implementation is known as an abstract method.

Syntax:-one body bastract also you can creat class also abstrct
abstract class Employee
{
  abstract void work(); 
}


3-Abstract Class and Abstract Methods
● In Java applications, if we declare any abstract class with abstract methods,
then it is convention to implement all the abstract methods by taking sub
classes.

● To access the abstract class members, we have to create an object for the
subclass and we have to create a reference variable either for abstract class
or for the subclass.

● If we create reference variables for abstract class then we are able to
access only abstract class members, we are unable to access subclass own
members.

● If we declare a reference variable for subclass then we are able to access
both abstract class members and subclass members.

What is Abstarct
- Unwantend data are remove used abstract key word
- it is a sucha methode have only have another signature Without any body
- The abstract keyword is used to achieve abstraction in Java.

role of Abstract 
-if one methode declare abstract  class also declare the Abstract
- you can not creat a object 
-in ABstract class you both Write a abstarct methode  & Non Abstract methode
-Abstarct class refrence creat but object are does not creat 
-Abstract key word used Class & methode
-Constarctor Are can not paticepet abstarction
