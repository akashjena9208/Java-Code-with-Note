final class
● If a class is marked as final, then the class won’t participate in inheritance,if
we try to do so then it would result in “CompileTime Error”.
Ex: String, StringBuffer,Integer,Float,......
-You declare the final class that not inherit the child class.
-class is restrict used a final


final variable
● If a variable is marked as final, then those variables are treated as compile
time constants and we should not change the value of those variables.
● If we try to change the value of those variables then it would result in
“CompileTimeError”.
