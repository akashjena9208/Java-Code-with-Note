1- HashMap
● Java HashMap allows null key and null values.
● HashMap is not an ordered collection. You can iterate over HashMap entries through keys set but 
they are not guaranteed to be in the order of their addition to the HashMap.
● HashMap is almost similar to Hashtable except that it’s non-synchronized and allows null key 
and values

ex:- HashMap hs=new HashMap<>();
         hs.put(07,"Dhoni");
