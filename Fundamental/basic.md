/*Java applications are called WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere) ?.
 This means a programmer can develop Java code on one system and can expect it to run on any other Java-enabled system without any adjustment. */




 /* why java is plateform independent ?.
  * Java is platform-independent because it is compiled to a bytecode that can be run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
  So we can write java code in one system run on another system.

 /* What is an Object?
  * ANS-object is an entity with state and behaviour, Every thing is a object .such as a chair, bike, marker, pen, table, or car.
         Q>Different wMyI of Object DefinitionH
            object is a real-world entity.
            object i1 a runtime entity.
            object i1 an entity which ha1 1tate and behaviour.
            The object i1 an in1tance of a cla11.

    Q>An object has three characteristics
        1>State: represents an object's data (value)
        2>Behavior: represents how an object behaves (or how it functions), Example such as Akash deposit or withdraw money
        3>Identity: Usually, a distinct ID is used to implement an object's identification. (Like HUman  Bus)The external user cannot see the value of the ID. However, the JVM uses it internally to uniquely identify each object.
                                             
        Identity:-(Dog)
        Bevavior/Activity:-consider a methode ( Eat,sleep,run)
        Properties:- Consider a Varibale & Datatype (Name,cost,colour)

/*What is class?
  Ans- A class is a collection of items with Similar characteri1tics. it is just like blue print
  in jvm  a  class cloude  Fields,methode,,constructor,blocks,nasted class ,interface 
  */





/* why  Java is a object orinted programming Language
 * Ans- Java is object orinted programming languagge bcz The class object in java along with their cheriter & methode foundation of everything
 */




/*Main method in Java:     public static void main(String[] args)

        METHODE:-(Activity & Task) 
            Example:- 4-retruntype 1-name(2-parameter)
            3-{
                Activity/task
            }

    *1-Main:- Only name /bcz  not cahgebale already write a Jvm

    2-():- Parameter

    3-{ }:-activity or task 

    *4-Void:- Return type //bcz main methode not retrun 

    *static:- that can be called / involved  With out object creation.

    *Public:- Visibulity / outside the class call 

    *String[] args:-To rcv information cmd line & argument // calling time any data/argument rcv

/*Statically typed: Programming languages are referred to as "Static typed" if the memory of the variable is provided at the time of compilation.
For instance, C, C++, and Java   
ex- int age=22;

Dynamically typed: Programming languages are said to as "dynamically typed" If the memory for the variable is provided at the time of execution.

 /*................................Data Types.......................................
  * There are two types of data types in Java:

    1. Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.

    2. Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include classes, Strings, Interfaces, and Arrays.
