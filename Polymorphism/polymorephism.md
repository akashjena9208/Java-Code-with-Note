In Genaral what is Poymorephrism
- one thing exist in more then one  form it is called so , its greek word ,poly mens many ,phrism means form, one thing many form

Ex= one Boy  
 he is go to School is Student
 He is go there patent  is  Son
 he is go to there Sibling brother


 it is a Two Type 

                - Static Polymorphism
                _ Dynamic Poymorphism


1-Staic Polymophism //Compile Time Polymorphism//
 -If Polymorphism Exist at Compile time taht is called Static
 ex- Methode Overloading(compile time)[Writing multipule methode have same name but differnt parameter]
    -Writting multipule methode have same name but their parametter are diffrent that is called methodeover loading.
    -methodeoverloading is compile time polymophirsm,bcz compile time cheack
    -Easy binding /Static type / Compile time polymophirsm

2- Dynamic Polymorphism // Runtime Polymorphism// true Polymorphism // late Polymorphism
- when Exesting Function replace after inherit the child class or
When  Polymorphism Exist at run time that is called Static
Ex- methode overriding(existing funcatilattly  have need you modfy that is called)
